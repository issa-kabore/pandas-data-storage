# pandas-data-storage

Repo contains a notebook showing a best way to save off data as files using python and pandas.  
When you are working with large datasets there comes a time when you need to store your data. Most people turn to CSV files because they are easy to share and universally used.   
But there are alternative ways of saving data files: pickle, parquet and feather files. 
I run some benchmarks to show that you can save time, space and keep the important metadata about your files in the process.
